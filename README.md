# Accident Prevention Bot
While driving on roads at hairpin section, many drivers face accident which results them into serious injuries or even death. The main reason behind this accident is curves and bends of roads while turning in Ghats. It becomes difficult to see vehicles coming from other The other reason for accident in hairpin section is that only one vehicle can turn at turnings at a time. If two vehicles come face to face while turning, it creates a chance of accidents and it becomes difficult to handle.


This project proposes an idea to reduce the accidents and provide safety measuring techniques in hairpin curves using sensors.
It uses two Ultrasonic sensors, which are placed on either side of the hairpin bend. Warning LEDs along with a Buzzer are also placed at the either side of the curve. The sensors are mutually connected to Arduino Uno through wires. Based on the output of sensors, position of vehicles on either side of the bend is detected which is provided as an input to the Arduino.

When a vehicle approaches the bend , the Arduino Uno triggers the warning LEDs and the Buzzers on the other side and thereby intelligently controlling the movement of vehicles at the bend.
